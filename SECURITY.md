# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Please use a private reporting channel, such as GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.

Include the following details where possible:
- Description of the issue
- Affected pages/paths
- Potential impact
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Suggested remediation

## Response Expectations

After receiving a valid report, maintainers aim to:
1. Acknowledge receipt promptly
2. Assess impact and affected versions
3. Prepare and publish a fix or mitigation
4. Coordinate disclosure timing where applicable

Response timelines may vary based on report complexity and maintainer availability.

If your report targets product runtime behavior outside this repository, include that context in your private report so it can be routed appropriately.
