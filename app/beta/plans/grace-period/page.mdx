# Grace Period

This page defines the `past_due` grace-period behavior and how it affects enforcement.

## Purpose

Grace period exists to avoid abrupt identity disruption while billing is unresolved.

## `past_due` Behavior

When an application enters `past_due`:

- A one-month grace window starts.
- Authentication remains available.
- Existing sessions continue to operate.
- Core enforcement behavior remains active.

## Post-Grace Behavior

If billing remains unresolved after grace period:

- The application can transition to a restricted lifecycle state.
- New authentication attempts can be limited.
- Feature access can be reduced according to lifecycle policy.

## Important Boundary

Lifecycle state and plan permissions are separate controls.

Plan defines capability scope, while lifecycle state determines operational eligibility.
