# Plans & Enforcement

This block defines how subscription plans and application lifecycle state affect runtime behavior.

It focuses on deterministic capability gating, not billing UI flows.

## Scope

This block covers:

- Plan capability overview
- Feature gating behavior
- Retention effects by plan
- Grace-period behavior for `past_due`

## Enforcement Principle

Plan and lifecycle state are evaluated explicitly.

AuditAuth does not apply implicit fallback behavior.

## Change Timing

- Immediate effects: feature-gating and access constraints by state/plan.
- Deferred effects: retention changes apply to new ingestion windows, not retroactive rewrites.
