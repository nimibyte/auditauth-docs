# Operational Transparency

Operational transparency defines what the system exposes, what it records, and what remains implicit.

Transparency in AuditAuth is structured but bounded.

The system favors explicit event logging over implicit system introspection.

---

## What Is Explicitly Logged

Audit logs capture:

- Authentication events
- Logout and refresh events
- Portal access
- Profile updates
- MFA enable/disable actions

Metrics capture:

- Request events
- Navigation events
- Custom events

These are the primary observable surfaces.

---

## What Is Not Fully Logged

Current Beta implementation does not systematically log:

- All access denial decisions
- All plan enforcement decisions
- All lifecycle transitions
- All administrative state changes
- All middleware-level rejections

Enforcement occurs at runtime, but not all enforcement decisions generate audit entries.

---

## Enforcement Visibility

When governance blocks access:

- The user is prevented from proceeding.
- The action may fail visibly.
- An explicit denial event is not always recorded.

There is no centralized "policy decision log."

Governance decisions are distributed across runtime layers.

---

## Observability of Governance

Governance actions are partially visible via:

- Audit logs (identity actions)
- Metrics (activity patterns)
- Dashboard feature availability

There is no consolidated governance event timeline.

Administrative changes may not always produce audit entries.

---

## Application Lifecycle Visibility

Application state transitions (e.g., active → past_due → suspended):

- Affect runtime behavior.
- Affect dashboard visibility.
- Affect login availability.

These transitions are not guaranteed to produce structured audit records in all cases.

Lifecycle transparency is operational, not fully historical.

---

## Plan Change Transparency

Plan upgrades and downgrades:

- Affect feature access immediately.
- Affect retention and sampling for new events.
- Affect dashboard access.

Historical data retention is not retroactively altered.

Plan enforcement actions are not exhaustively logged as separate governance events.

---

## Metrics Transparency Limits

Metrics ingestion:

- Requires apiKey and appId.
- Does not require user authentication.

If a user is disabled:

- Metrics may still be recorded at application level.

There is no per-user metrics blocking.

Observability operates at application boundary.

---

## Transparency Philosophy

AuditAuth prioritizes:

- Explicit domain events
- Deterministic enforcement
- Structured logging of identity actions

It does not attempt to:

- Log every runtime decision
- Act as a policy engine auditor
- Provide compliance-grade governance journaling

Operational transparency is structured but intentionally bounded.

---

## Beta Limitations

Current Beta transparency gaps include:

- No full enforcement decision log
- No tamper-evident audit chaining
- No dedicated lifecycle transition audit stream
- No centralized governance event index

These may evolve in future versions.

---

## Architectural Position

Operational transparency in AuditAuth is:

- Identity-focused
- Governance-aware
- Plan-bound
- Explicit about limitations

It provides structured traceability.

It does not claim exhaustive policy introspection.
