# Compliance Boundaries

AuditAuth provides governance-grade infrastructure.

It does not claim regulatory certification.

This section defines the explicit compliance boundaries of the system.

---

## What AuditAuth Provides

AuditAuth provides:

- Identity-aware audit logging
- Plan-bound retention enforcement
- Physical TTL-based deletion
- Deterministic runtime access control
- Application-scoped observability
- Structured governance surfaces

These capabilities support compliance efforts.

They do not automatically confer compliance certification.

---

## What AuditAuth Does Not Claim

AuditAuth does not currently provide:

- SOC 2 certification
- ISO 27001 certification
- HIPAA compliance guarantees
- GDPR certification claims
- PCI-DSS compliance guarantees
- WORM storage guarantees
- Cryptographically chained audit logs
- Tamper-evident log integrity proofs

Organizations are responsible for their own regulatory posture.

AuditAuth provides infrastructure components, not certification.

---

## Data Retention Guarantees

Retention is:

- Deterministic
- TTL-enforced
- Physical
- Plan-bound
- Forward-only

There is no:

- Hidden archival layer
- Cold storage tier
- Regulatory export pipeline
- Immutable long-term storage guarantee

Expired data is permanently removed.

---

## PII Handling

Audit logs may contain:

- Email addresses

Metrics do not include identity PII by default.

Custom metadata may include arbitrary data.

Applications are responsible for:

- Avoiding sensitive metadata
- Managing regulatory data obligations
- Handling user data deletion requests outside TTL window

AuditAuth does not automatically anonymize custom metadata.

---

## Multi-Tenancy Model

Data isolation is logical:

- Scoped by application
- Validated by apiKey and appId
- Enforced via query filters

There is no:

- Physical tenant database separation
- Dedicated per-tenant storage
- Infrastructure-level isolation per application

Isolation is enforced at application boundary.

---

## Runtime Enforcement Guarantees

Access control is:

- Runtime-evaluated
- Identity-aware
- Application-aware
- Plan-aware

Enforcement is deterministic but:

- Not centrally journaled
- Not cryptographically signed
- Not compliance-certified

Governance enforcement is operational, not regulatory.

---

## Beta Disclosure

Current Beta characteristics:

- No formal compliance certification
- No audit immutability chaining
- No centralized enforcement log
- No regulatory export layer
- No advanced encryption-at-rest customization per tenant

The system is infrastructure-focused and evolving.

---

## Intended Position

AuditAuth is:

- Identity infrastructure
- Governance-aligned
- Plan-enforced
- Deterministic
- Transparent about boundaries

It is not:

- A compliance automation product
- A regulatory certification platform
- A dedicated GRC solution

Organizations must layer additional controls if regulatory guarantees are required.

---

## Evolution Path

Future enhancements may include:

- Stronger audit immutability guarantees
- Dedicated enforcement event logging
- Exportable governance records
- Cryptographic integrity verification
- Improved tenant isolation options

Compliance posture evolves alongside infrastructure maturity.

---

## Final Position

AuditAuth provides structured governance capabilities.

It does not substitute formal compliance programs.

Transparency about boundaries is part of its design philosophy.
