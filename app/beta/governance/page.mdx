# Governance & Compliance

Governance in AuditAuth is identity-centered.

It defines:

- Who can access what
- What actions are recorded
- How long data is retained
- How lifecycle transitions are enforced
- What visibility administrators have

Governance is not an add-on.

It is embedded into:

- Identity model
- Observability model
- Plan enforcement
- Application lifecycle

---

## Governance Scope

Governance in AuditAuth covers:

- Identity lifecycle control
- Session invalidation
- Real-time user disabling
- Audit log retention
- Plan-based feature gating
- Application state enforcement

Governance is applied at the infrastructure layer.

---

## Identity Governance

Identity governance includes:

- Per-user enable/disable state
- MFA enablement controls
- Session revocation
- Real-time access blocking

When an identity is disabled:

- Login is blocked immediately.
- Middleware checks prevent access.
- Active sessions are effectively neutralized.

Access tokens may remain valid until expiration (max 30 minutes).

However:

- Middleware validation blocks platform access in real time.

Governance operates independently of token expiration alone.

---

## Application Governance

Applications have lifecycle states:

- active
- past_due
- suspended

Application state affects:

- Login availability
- Dashboard visibility
- Portal access
- Metrics ingestion
- Audit log visibility

Governance decisions are deterministic and enforced at runtime.

---

## Plan Governance

Plans control:

- Feature access
- Sampling rate
- Retention window
- Dashboard availability
- Export capability

Plan changes affect:

- Future ingestion behavior
- Dashboard visibility
- Enforcement rules

Plan changes do not retroactively alter historical storage rules.

---

## Audit Governance

Audit logs provide:

- Immutable record of identity events
- Plan-bound retention
- Structured action tracing

Audit coverage focuses on:

- Authentication events
- Portal actions
- MFA configuration changes

Audit does not yet:

- Cryptographically sign logs
- Provide WORM guarantees
- Record all enforcement decisions

---

## Observability Governance

Observability respects:

- Plan retention boundaries
- Sampling configuration
- Dashboard feature gating

Metrics ingestion is application-bound.

Metrics are not identity-scoped.

Observability is not a compliance-grade analytics engine.

---

## Real-Time Enforcement

Governance enforcement occurs at:

- Authentication exchange
- Middleware validation
- Feature-level access checks
- Dashboard-level gating

Real-time blocking is implemented for:

- Disabled identities
- Suspended applications

Governance decisions are evaluated per request.

---

## Compliance Positioning (Beta)

Current Beta guarantees:

- Physical TTL deletion
- Deterministic ingestion enforcement
- Logical data isolation
- Identity-aware audit logging

Current Beta limitations:

- No cryptographic audit immutability
- No full compliance certification
- No per-tenant physical isolation
- No external compliance reporting export layer

AuditAuth is infrastructure-grade, not compliance-certified.

---

## Architectural Philosophy

Governance in AuditAuth is:

- Identity-first
- Deterministic
- Runtime-enforced
- Plan-aware
- Explicit about boundaries

It is designed for serious applications.

Not for superficial authentication layers.
