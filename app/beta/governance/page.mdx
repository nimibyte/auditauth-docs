# Governance & Audit

AuditAuth couples identity enforcement with structured governance.

Governance captures identity state transitions as inspectable records.

Every relevant identity event is application-scoped and queryable.

---

## Audit Model

AuditAuth records identity-related events at the application level.

These include:

- Authentication attempts and outcomes.
- Session creation and termination.
- Token refresh outcomes.
- User profile and security-sensitive updates.

Audit events are immutable once recorded.

They are scoped per application.

---

## Event Structure

Each audit event contains:

- Event type and category.
- Subject identity reference.
- Application scope identifier.
- Event timestamp.
- Context metadata.
- Security attributes required for traceability.

Events are designed for traceability, not for generic analytics.

They describe identity state transitions.

---

## Application Isolation

Audit logs are isolated per application.

A user interacting with multiple applications generates independent audit trails.

There is no cross-application audit bleed.

Isolation is a core architectural boundary.

---

## Session-Level Traceability

AuditAuth links audit events to sessions.

This enables:

- Reconstruction of authentication timelines.
- Session-centric incident review.
- Correlation between auth, refresh, and revocation events.
- Compliance-oriented evidentiary trails.

Audit data is identity-aware by design.

---

## Governance Principles

### Centralized Recording

All identity events flow through AuditAuth.

Applications SHOULD NOT create parallel authentication truth sources.

### Deterministic State

Every session transition is represented by an audit event.

No implicit state changes exist outside the system.

### Immutable Event History

Audit logs are append-only.

Historical integrity is preserved.

---

## Compliance Considerations

AuditAuth enables:

- Structured event inspection.
- Historical traceability.
- Session reconstruction.
- Governance-ready reporting.

Retention and export policies are configurable at the application level.

---

## Observability vs Governance

Governance is not analytics.

Audit logs focus on:

- Security control evidence.
- Identity state transitions.
- Compliance traceability.
- Deterministic forensic reconstruction.

For behavioral metrics and usage insights, continue to:

- Observability
