# Governance & Audit

Authentication without governance is incomplete.

AuditAuth integrates identity with structured auditability and traceability.

Every relevant identity event is recorded, scoped, and inspectable.

---

## Audit Model

AuditAuth records identity-related events at the application level.

These include:

- Authentication attempts
- Successful logins
- Failed authentication
- Session creation
- Session invalidation
- Token refresh events
- Profile updates
- Security-sensitive changes

Audit events are immutable once recorded.

They are scoped per application.

---

## Event Structure

Each audit event contains:

- Event type
- User identifier
- Application identifier
- Timestamp
- Metadata payload
- Security context

Events are designed for traceability, not for generic analytics.

They describe identity state transitions.

---

## Application Isolation

Audit logs are isolated per application.

A user interacting with multiple applications generates independent audit trails.

There is no cross-application audit bleed.

Isolation is a core architectural boundary.

---

## Session-Level Traceability

AuditAuth links audit events to sessions.

This enables:

- Reconstruction of authentication timelines
- Investigation of suspicious behavior
- Session-level activity review
- Security audits

Audit data is identity-aware by design.

---

## Governance Principles

### Centralized Recording

All identity events flow through AuditAuth.

Applications do not implement their own logging for authentication state.

### Deterministic State

Every session transition is represented by an audit event.

No implicit state changes exist outside the system.

### Immutable Event History

Audit logs are append-only.

Historical integrity is preserved.

---

## Compliance Considerations

AuditAuth enables:

- Structured event inspection
- Historical traceability
- Session reconstruction
- Governance-ready reporting

Retention and export policies are configurable at the application level.

---

## Observability vs Governance

Governance is not analytics.

Audit logs focus on:

- Security
- Identity transitions
- Compliance
- Traceability

For behavioral metrics and usage insights, continue to:

- Observability
