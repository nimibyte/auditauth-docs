# Introduction

AuditAuth is an identity control plane for modern applications.

It centralizes authentication, token issuance, session lifecycle, and identity telemetry, while applications enforce access at runtime.

---

## What AuditAuth Is

AuditAuth is a centralized Identity Provider (IdP) that:

- Authenticates users using managed identity flows.
- Issues scoped access and refresh tokens.
- Persists and rotates session state.
- Records identity and security events.
- Emits request and navigation telemetry tied to identity context.
- Exposes portal and account-management flows through controlled redirects.

AuditAuth is not an in-app login helper. It is an externalized identity layer with deterministic enforcement contracts.

## What AuditAuth Is Not

AuditAuth is not:

- An embedded authentication implementation in your frontend.
- A UI widget library for local credential handling.
- A replacement for your authorization or business policy layer.
- A generic analytics product.

Applications MUST enforce identity state. They MUST NOT implement credential validation or token issuance.

---

## System Overview

AuditAuth is structured in four layers:

### Identity Layer

Handles:

- Authentication challenges and credential validation.
- Access and refresh token issuance.
- Session creation, refresh, and revocation.
- Provider orchestration (email, social, MFA).

### Enforcement Layer

SDKs enforce:

- Session validity at runtime boundaries.
- Token verification and refresh behavior.
- Route/API protection for private resources.
- Secure redirection into managed auth and portal routes.

SDKs enforce identity state; they do not authenticate users.

### Governance Layer

Provides:

- Immutable audit events for identity state transitions.
- Session-linked activity traces.
- Security-oriented event history.
- Application-scoped governance data.

### Observability Layer

Provides:

- Request and navigation metrics by session context.
- Runtime visibility across browser and server flows.
- Aggregate identity telemetry for operational monitoring.
- Low-friction instrumentation through SDK defaults.

Identity events become observable operational signals.

## Core Principles

### Centralized Authentication

Authentication is owned by AuditAuth.

Applications MUST redirect to AuditAuth instead of re-implementing login flows.

### Identity-Driven Observability

Authentication and session interactions are traceable through identity-aware telemetry.

### Application Isolation

Each application has an isolated identity scope and independent trust boundary.

### SDK as Enforcement Layer

SDKs do not authenticate users.

They validate and enforce identity state.

## Who AuditAuth Is For

AuditAuth is designed for applications that require:

- Centralized authentication with strict runtime enforcement.
- Session governance and deterministic identity failure behavior.
- Auditable identity event history.
- Identity-aware metrics without custom telemetry plumbing.
- Branded, externalized identity UX.

This includes SaaS platforms, internal tools, and enterprise-grade applications.

## Next Steps

- Understand the `Architecture` model and boundaries.
- Select the `Integration` model that matches your runtime.
- Review `Security & Trust Model`, `Observability`, and `Plans & Enforcement`.
