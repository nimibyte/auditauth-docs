# Observability

Identity is not only about authentication.

It is about understanding how authenticated users interact with your application.

AuditAuth provides identity-aware observability.

Observability is scoped per application and tied directly to authenticated sessions.

---

## Identity-Aware Metrics

Traditional analytics tools operate independently from authentication systems.

AuditAuth connects:

- Sessions
- Authentication events
- Navigation behavior
- Interaction metrics

Every metric is associated with an authenticated identity context.

---

## Session Metrics

AuditAuth tracks:

- Active sessions
- Session duration
- Session refresh cycles
- Session termination reasons

This enables:

- Real-time session visibility
- Detection of anomalous session behavior
- Per-application session analysis

---

## Authentication Metrics

AuditAuth exposes:

- Login success rate
- Failed authentication attempts
- MFA usage rate
- Provider distribution (email vs social)

Authentication performance becomes measurable.

---

## Navigation Metrics

Navigation metrics are tied to authenticated sessions.

They include:

- Page transitions
- Session navigation flow
- Entry and exit points
- Interaction-level events

These metrics are identity-scoped, not anonymous.

---

## Lightweight by Design

AuditAuth is not a full analytics platform.

It does not replace:

- Business intelligence tools
- Marketing analytics
- Product analytics platforms

It provides identity-layer observability.

The focus is on how authentication and session state interact with application behavior.

---

## Dashboard Model

Observability data is exposed through:

- Application dashboards
- Aggregated metrics
- Session-level inspection
- Time-based filtering

Dashboards are scoped per application.

There is no cross-application data leakage.

---

## Observability Principles

### Identity Context First

Metrics are tied to authenticated sessions.

### Application Isolation

Each application has independent observability scope.

### Minimal Client Responsibility

The SDK emits identity-related metrics automatically.

Applications do not implement custom tracking logic for identity behavior.

---

## When to Use It

Observability is useful for:

- Monitoring authentication health.
- Detecting abnormal login patterns.
- Understanding session stability.
- Reviewing navigation behavior tied to identity.
