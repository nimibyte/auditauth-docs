# Observability

Identity operations require runtime visibility, not only authentication success.

AuditAuth exposes identity-aware observability signals tied to session context.

Observability is application-scoped and linked to authenticated flows.

## Identity-Aware Metrics

Traditional analytics tools operate independently from authentication systems.

AuditAuth connects:

- Session state.
- Authentication outcomes.
- Request behavior.
- Navigation paths.

Every metric is associated with an authenticated identity context.

---

## Session Metrics

AuditAuth tracks:

- Session activity windows.
- Refresh frequency and outcomes.
- Session continuity indicators.
- Termination patterns.

This enables:

- Real-time session health checks.
- Detection of unusual session behavior.
- Per-application stability analysis.

---

## Authentication Metrics

AuditAuth exposes:

- Login success/failure ratios.
- Authentication failure patterns.
- MFA utilization.
- Provider-level distribution.

Authentication performance becomes measurable.

---

## Navigation Metrics

Navigation metrics are tied to authenticated sessions.

They include:

- Page transitions.
- Session path sequences.
- Entry and exit paths.
- Runtime-scoped navigation events.

These metrics are identity-scoped, not anonymous.

---

## Lightweight by Design

AuditAuth is not a full analytics platform.

It does not replace:

- Business intelligence suites.
- Marketing analytics stacks.
- Product analytics instrumentation.

It provides identity-layer telemetry.

The focus is on how authentication and session state interact with application behavior.

---

## Dashboard Model

Observability data is exposed through:

- Application dashboards.
- Aggregated identity metrics.
- Session-level inspection.
- Time-window filtering.

Dashboards are scoped per application.

There is no cross-application data leakage.

---

## Observability Principles

### Identity Context First

Metrics are tied to authenticated sessions.

### Application Isolation

Each application has independent observability scope.

### Minimal Client Responsibility

The SDK emits identity-related metrics automatically.

Applications SHOULD avoid duplicating identity telemetry pipelines when SDK signals are sufficient.

---

## When to Use It

Observability is useful for:

- Monitoring authentication health.
- Detecting abnormal login patterns.
- Understanding session stability.
- Reviewing identity-scoped navigation behavior.
