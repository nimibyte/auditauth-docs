# AuditAuth Beta Documentation

This documentation is organized into six blocks, each with a clear reader intent:

- `Introduction` for product context and positioning
- `Architecture` for system model and component boundaries
- `Integration` for SDK implementation paths
- `Security & Trust Model` for formal contracts and protocol behavior
- `Observability` for audit and metrics behavior
- `Plans & Enforcement` for plan-gated capability behavior

An additional `API Reference (Advanced)` block provides compact formal contracts.

If you are integrating AuditAuth, start with `Integration`.

If you are reviewing guarantees and limits, start with `Security & Trust Model`.
