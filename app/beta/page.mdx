# AuditAuth

AuditAuth is an identity infrastructure platform designed for modern applications.

It provides authentication, session control, governance, and observability as a unified layer — without pushing complexity into client applications.

## What AuditAuth Is

AuditAuth is a centralized Identity Provider (IdP) that:

- Authenticates users (email, social providers, MFA).
- Manages sessions and token lifecycle.
- Enforces access at the application boundary.
- Tracks authentication and user activity events.
- Provides audit logs and dashboards.
- Exposes lightweight observability for sessions and navigation.
- Offers a customizable user portal and authentication interface.

AuditAuth is not just a login system.

It is the identity control plane for your application.

---

## What AuditAuth Is Not

AuditAuth is not:

- A frontend authentication helper.
- A UI component library.
- A database for users embedded in your app.
- A wrapper around OAuth providers.

Client applications do not authenticate users.

They enforce that authentication has already happened in AuditAuth.

## System Overview

AuditAuth is structured in four layers:

### Identity Layer

Handles:

- Authentication methods.
- Token generation and rotation.
- Session lifecycle.
- Multi-factor authentication.

### Enforcement Layer

SDKs enforce:

- Session validity.
- Access control.
- Token refresh.
- Secure communication with AuditAuth.

Applications never implement authentication logic directly.

### Governance Layer

Provides:

- Audit logs.
- Authentication events.
- User activity traceability.
- Compliance-oriented event storage.

### Observability Layer

Provides:

- Session analytics.
- Navigation metrics.
- Lightweight activity dashboards.
- Real-time interaction insights.

Identity becomes observable infrastructure.

## Core Principles

### Centralized Authentication

Authentication is owned by AuditAuth.

Applications do not replicate login logic.

### Identity-Driven Observability

Every authentication and session event is traceable.

### Application Isolation

Each application operates within its own isolated identity boundary.

### SDK as Enforcement Layer

SDKs do not authenticate users.

They validate and enforce identity state.

## Who AuditAuth Is For

AuditAuth is designed for applications that require:

- Structured identity management.
- Session governance.
- User activity traceability.
- Integrated authentication and observability.
- Customizable authentication and user experience.

This includes SaaS platforms, internal tools, and enterprise-grade applications.
