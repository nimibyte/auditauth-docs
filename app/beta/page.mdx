# AuditAuth

AuditAuth is a full Identity Provider (IdP) designed for modern applications.

It owns the complete authentication lifecycle:

- Login UI
- OAuth providers
- Session management
- Access + Refresh tokens
- Audit logs
- Metrics
- Multi-tenant applications

---

## What AuditAuth Is Not

AuditAuth is not a frontend authentication helper.

Client applications:

- Do not implement OAuth.
- Do not manage providers.
- Do not handle MFA.
- Do not store identity logic.

Authentication happens in AuditAuth.

The SDK enforces that authentication has already happened.

## Quickstart

Install the Next.js SDK:

```bash
npm install @auditauth/next
```

Create route handlers:

```ts
export const { GET, POST } = auditauth.getHandlers();
```

Add middleware:

```ts
export default auditauth.middleware();
```

Protect a route.

Done.

## Core Principle

> AuditAuth SDKs do not authenticate users.  
> They enforce that authentication has already happened in AuditAuth.
