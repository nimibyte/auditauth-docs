# Application Model

In AuditAuth, an Application is the primary operational boundary.

It represents a single logical system integrating AuditAuth as its identity infrastructure.

Applications are fully isolated from one another.

---

## Isolation Boundary

Each application maintains:

- Independent authentication configuration
- Dedicated user scope
- Separate audit logs
- Independent observability metrics
- Distinct subscription state

There is no implicit identity sharing between applications.

A user authenticated in one application does not gain access to another.

---

## Application Identifier

Every application is identified by a unique `app_id`.

This identifier is:

- Embedded in issued access tokens
- Used during backend verification
- Required for SDK configuration
- Enforced during token validation

Tokens are application-scoped.

Backends must validate that the `app_id` matches the expected service context.

---

## User Scope per Application

Users are associated with applications.

Although a single email may exist across multiple applications,
identity state is scoped independently.

This ensures:

- Isolation of permissions
- Independent audit trails
- Application-level enforcement
- No cross-application token reuse

---

## Subscription Scope

Subscription and plan state are assigned per application.

This means:

- One application may be on a Starter plan.
- Another application under the same organization may be on Enterprise.
- Lifecycle state is independent per application.

Billing does not operate globally.

It operates per application boundary.

---

## Configuration Scope

Authentication providers, MFA settings, and whitelabel configuration are defined per application.

Examples:

- One application may allow only Google login.
- Another may allow Google, Apple, and password.
- One may enforce MFA.
- Another may not.

Identity configuration is not shared implicitly.

---

## Observability Scope

Metrics and audit logs are stored per application.

Dashboards reflect:

- Only that application's activity.
- Only that application's sessions.
- Only that application's events.

There is no cross-application aggregation unless explicitly designed at a higher organizational level.

---

## State Coupling

Application state affects:

- Authentication availability
- Feature access
- Metrics retention
- Audit log availability
- Dashboard visibility

User authentication state remains separate from application subscription state.

An authenticated user does not override application-level restrictions.

---

## Architectural Implication

Applications are the atomic unit of identity governance in AuditAuth.

All enforcement decisions consider:

- Application scope
- Plan permissions
- Lifecycle state
- Token claims

Identity is not global.

It is explicitly application-bound.
