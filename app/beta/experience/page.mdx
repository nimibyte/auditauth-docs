# User Experience Layer

AuditAuth does not stop at authentication logic.

It provides a complete user-facing identity experience.

This includes authentication interfaces, user profile management, and configurable branding.

---

## Authentication Interface

AuditAuth owns the authentication UI.

Applications redirect users to AuditAuth for:

- Login
- Registration
- MFA verification
- Password recovery

Authentication interfaces are centralized.

Applications do not implement custom login flows.

---

## User Portal

Each application includes a user-facing portal.

The portal allows users to:

- Manage profile information
- Update security settings
- Review active sessions
- Terminate sessions
- Manage authentication methods

The portal is identity-scoped per application.

---

## Whitelabel Customization

AuditAuth supports configurable branding.

Applications can define:

- Logo
- Color palette
- Typography
- Domain configuration

Authentication and portal interfaces adapt to application branding.

The identity layer remains centralized while the user experience remains application-specific.

---

## Domain Strategy

AuditAuth operates on dedicated domains for authentication and portal interaction.

Applications integrate through controlled redirects.

Authentication never happens inside the client application domain.

---

## UX Principles

### Centralized Identity Experience

Users interact with a consistent authentication system.

### Application-Level Branding

Each application maintains visual identity while sharing identity infrastructure.

### Minimal Application Responsibility

Applications do not build login pages or profile management flows.

They integrate and enforce identity state.

---

## Identity as a User Interface Boundary

AuditAuth defines a clear separation:

- Authentication and identity UX live in AuditAuth.
- Business logic and application UX live in the client application.

This reduces complexity and improves security posture.
