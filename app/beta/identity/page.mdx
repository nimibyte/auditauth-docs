# Identity

The Identity layer is responsible for authenticating users and issuing secure sessions.

It defines how users are verified, how tokens are generated, and how sessions are maintained across applications.

Identity is centralized in AuditAuth.

Applications never implement authentication logic directly.

---

## Authentication Methods

AuditAuth supports multiple authentication mechanisms:

- Email and password
- Social providers
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Authentication is always performed within AuditAuth’s domain.

Client applications redirect users to AuditAuth when authentication is required.

Credentials never pass through the client application.

---

## Authentication Flow

The high-level authentication flow is:

1. User attempts to access a protected resource.
2. SDK detects missing or invalid session.
3. User is redirected to AuditAuth.
4. Authentication is completed.
5. AuditAuth issues tokens.
6. User is redirected back to the application.
7. SDK validates and enforces session state.

Authentication and enforcement are separate responsibilities.

---

## Token Model

AuditAuth uses a dual-token model:

- Access Token
- Refresh Token

### Access Token

- Short-lived
- Used for authenticated API requests
- Scoped to a specific application

### Refresh Token

- Long-lived
- Used to issue new access tokens
- Rotated securely

Tokens are never generated inside the client application.

---

## Session Model

A session represents an authenticated identity within a specific application.

A session includes:

- Authenticated user identity
- Application context
- Token pair
- Metadata (creation time, rotation state, etc.)

Sessions are:

- Created after successful authentication
- Rotated automatically
- Invalidated on logout or security events

---

## Session Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a session includes:

- Creation
- Validation
- Refresh
- Invalidation

SDKs handle validation and refresh logic automatically.

If refresh fails, the session is terminated and the user is redirected to authenticate again.

---

## Application Scope

Sessions are scoped per application.

A user authenticated in one application does not implicitly gain access to another.

Each application maintains isolated identity boundaries.

---

## Security Considerations

- Authentication credentials are never exposed to client applications.
- Token rotation reduces long-lived token risk.
- Session invalidation propagates immediately.
- Identity boundaries are enforced at the SDK layer.
