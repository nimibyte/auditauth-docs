# Security & Trust Model

Purpose: describe the conceptual security architecture used by AuditAuth.

This block explains how token validation, session state, identity state, and plan/lifecycle enforcement work together.

## Scope

This section is conceptual and architecture-focused.

Formal endpoint contracts, error schemas, and request limits are documented in `API Reference (Advanced)`.

## Beta Characteristics

Current Beta behavior includes:

- Public key endpoint support (`GET /v1/public_key`)
- No JWKS endpoint
- Deterministic refresh/session enforcement
- State-aware runtime enforcement
