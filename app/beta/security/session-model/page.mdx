# Session Model

Purpose: describe the stateful layer that governs identity continuity.

## Model

Session state is the authoritative control for long-lived access.

It governs:

- Refresh eligibility
- Revocation
- Sliding expiration behavior
- Session continuity boundaries

## Refresh Rotation

Refresh tokens are rotated on refresh.

Previous refresh material becomes invalid once rotation succeeds.

This constrains replay and keeps continuity state explicit.

## Real-Time State Enforcement

Session state and identity state are checked during runtime enforcement.

If identity is disabled, access is blocked in real time even when a previously issued access token still exists.

## Plan and Lifecycle Interaction

Session validity does not bypass application controls.

Plan and lifecycle state can restrict behavior independently from token validity.

## Formal Contract

For refresh/logout/session endpoint contracts and cookie behavior, see `API Reference (Advanced) > Session Endpoints`.
