# Trust Boundaries

Purpose: define how AuditAuth layers trust decisions at runtime.

## Layered Trust Model

AuditAuth evaluates trust in layers:

1. Token cryptographic validity
2. Session state validity
3. Identity state eligibility
4. Application lifecycle eligibility
5. Plan/feature enforcement eligibility

All layers must pass.

## State-Aware Enforcement

Token validity is not sole authority.

If identity or application state changes, runtime enforcement can block access immediately, independent of previously issued token lifetime.

## Domain and Scope Boundaries

- Authentication responsibilities remain centralized in AuditAuth.
- Applications enforce identity state through SDK boundaries.
- Identity and observability scopes are application-bound.

## Beta Notes

- Public key endpoint exists.
- JWKS and multi-key rotation are not available in Beta.
