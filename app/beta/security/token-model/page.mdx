# Token Model

Purpose: describe how AuditAuth uses tokens in the enforcement model.

## Model

AuditAuth uses two token types:

- Access token: signed JWT, short-lived, used for request authorization
- Refresh token: opaque, state-bound, used to continue session lifecycle

## Security Properties

- JWT signature provides integrity and issuer authenticity.
- Access tokens are intentionally short-lived.
- Refresh tokens are rotated on refresh and validated against session state.

## Enforcement Context

A valid JWT is necessary but not sufficient for access.

Runtime access decisions also depend on:

- Session state
- Identity state
- Application lifecycle and plan constraints

## Formal Contract

For header/claims/TTL and verification details, see `API Reference (Advanced) > JWT Specification`.
