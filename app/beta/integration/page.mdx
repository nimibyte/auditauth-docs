# Integration Overview

AuditAuth is designed to integrate into applications as an external identity control plane.

Integration does not embed authentication logic inside your application.

It connects your application to a centralized identity infrastructure.

---

## Supported Integration Models

AuditAuth supports multiple integration models depending on your application architecture:

- Server-enforced model (Next.js or similar frameworks)
- Single Page Application (SPA) model
- Backend token verification for services

Each model enforces identity differently.

---

## Recommended Model: Server-Enforced Integration

The recommended integration strategy is a server-enforced model.

In this model:

- The SDK runs on the server.
- Session validation happens server-side.
- Tokens are never exposed to frontend code.
- Authentication redirects are controlled by middleware.

This model minimizes security surface area and centralizes identity enforcement.

Frameworks like Next.js are ideal for this pattern.

---

## SPA Model

For applications without a server boundary, AuditAuth provides a Web SDK.

In this model:

- The client application manages redirects.
- Tokens may be accessible in the browser.
- Additional security considerations apply.

The SPA model is supported but not the primary recommendation.

---

## Backend Verification

For distributed systems and APIs:

- Services can validate access tokens.
- Token signatures are verified.
- Service-to-service identity validation is possible.

This model is used in multi-service environments.

---

## Integration Philosophy

AuditAuth enforces a strict rule:

Applications enforce identity.
They do not implement authentication.

Authentication logic remains centralized in AuditAuth.

---

## Choosing a Model

Your architecture determines the integration model.

If your framework supports a server boundary, use the server-enforced model.

If not, use the SPA integration carefully and understand its security implications.

## Next Step

To integrate AuditAuth into a production application, continue with:

- Next.js (Recommended)
