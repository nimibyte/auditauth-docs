# Observability Trade-offs

Observability in AuditAuth is intentionally constrained.

It is designed to complement identity infrastructure, not replace a full analytics platform.

This section outlines explicit architectural trade-offs.

---

## Design Priorities

The current architecture prioritizes:

- Deterministic ingestion behavior
- Plan-aware enforcement
- Physical TTL-based retention
- Minimal background processes
- Low operational complexity
- Clear identity boundary separation

These priorities shape all implementation decisions.

---

## What Observability Is

Observability in AuditAuth is:

- Identity-aware (via audit logs)
- Application-scoped (via metrics)
- Retention-bound
- Sampling-controlled
- Query-driven
- Near real-time
- Beta-stage

It provides operational insight for identity-integrated applications.

---

## What Observability Is Not

It is not:

- A full analytics data warehouse
- A streaming event pipeline
- A SIEM replacement
- A log ingestion platform
- A compliance-grade immutable ledger
- A real-time alerting system
- A distributed aggregation cluster

Those capabilities require different architectural layers.

---

## Trade-Off: Simplicity vs Scale

The system avoids:

- Pre-aggregation layers
- Materialized views
- Streaming consumers
- External analytics engines
- Caching tiers

This simplifies infrastructure and reduces operational overhead.

However:

- Large-scale deployments may require external analytics.
- High event volumes may require custom indexing strategies.
- Extreme real-time requirements are out of scope.

---

## Trade-Off: Logical Isolation vs Physical Isolation

Data isolation is logical:

- Application-scoped filtering
- API-level validation

There is no:

- Per-application database
- Physical data partitioning
- Built-in sharding configuration

This simplifies deployment.

It does not provide infrastructure-level tenant isolation.

---

## Trade-Off: Audit Integrity vs Cryptographic Guarantees

Audit logs are:

- Append-only
- TTL-enforced
- Identity-aware

They are not:

- Cryptographically chained
- Tamper-evident
- WORM-compliant

Future versions may introduce stronger immutability guarantees.

---

## Trade-Off: Identity Scope vs User Analytics

Metrics are:

- Application-scoped
- Session-aware
- Not directly tied to user identity

This design:

- Reduces PII exposure
- Simplifies data protection boundaries

It does not support deep per-user behavioral analytics.

---

## Trade-Off: Deterministic Sampling vs Analytical Fidelity

Sampling is applied:

- At ingestion
- Per event
- Probabilistically

This ensures predictable storage usage.

It may reduce analytical precision at lower tiers.

Higher-tier plans mitigate this via increased sampling rate.

---

## Beta Characteristics

Current Beta limitations include:

- No materialized aggregation layer
- No caching layer
- No explicit compound indexing strategy
- No systematic enforcement event logging
- No raw metrics export endpoint
- No per-user observability boundary

These limitations are explicit and intentional.

The architecture favors clarity over premature complexity.

---

## Strategic Position

Observability in AuditAuth is:

- Identity-aligned
- Governance-compatible
- Plan-aware
- Deterministic
- Infrastructure-focused

It is designed to integrate seamlessly with authentication and lifecycle enforcement.

It is not intended to replace dedicated analytics or compliance systems.

---

## Evolution Path

Future evolution may include:

- JWKS endpoint (Identity)
- Stronger audit immutability guarantees
- Enforcement event logging
- Dedicated analytics export endpoints
- Improved indexing strategies
- Optional aggregation caching layer

AuditAuth evolves in layers.

Observability is one of those layers.

---

## Conclusion

Observability Internals are intentionally:

- Structured
- Minimal
- Deterministic
- Explicit about boundaries

The system is built for clarity and composability.

Not maximal feature density.
