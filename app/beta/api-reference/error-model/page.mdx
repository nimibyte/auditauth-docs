# Error Model

Purpose: define HTTP error behavior for integration and enforcement handling.

## Response Shape

Typical error responses use a structured JSON payload with an error code/message contract.

Applications should branch on HTTP status first, then error code where available.

## Common Status Codes

- `401 Unauthorized`: invalid or expired token/session, refresh failure, auth required
- `403 Forbidden`: valid identity but blocked by policy, plan, or lifecycle restrictions
- `404 Not Found`: unknown route/action or unavailable endpoint
- `429 Too Many Requests`: request-rate threshold exceeded
- `5xx`: upstream or internal processing failure

## Client Handling Guidance

- `401`: trigger re-authentication or refresh path
- `403`: show explicit access-restricted state
- `429`: retry with backoff
- `5xx`: fail closed and surface transient error state
