# Error Model

Applications should branch on HTTP status first, then parse the message for endpoint-specific reason.

## Standard Shape

```json
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Authorization code not found, invalid, or expired",
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```

## Core Status Semantics

- `400 Bad Request`: payload shape invalid or required fields missing
- `401 Unauthorized`: missing token/header, invalid code, expired/revoked session
- `403 Forbidden`: feature/provider blocked by current plan permissions
- `404 Not Found`: application, identity, or feature config not found
- `409 Conflict`: plan limit conflict (for example max users reached)
- `429 Too Many Requests`: throttling limit exceeded
- `5xx`: transient platform or upstream error

## Handling Recommendations

- `400`: fail fast and correct payload/client contract
- `401`: restart login or token lifecycle flow
- `403`: surface explicit plan/permission restriction to operators
- `404`: validate IDs, API key binding, and environment
- `409`: show capacity/business conflict guidance
- `429`: apply retry with backoff and jitter
