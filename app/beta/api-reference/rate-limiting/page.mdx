# Rate Limiting

AuditAuth enforces request throttling to protect platform stability.

## Enforcement

- Exceeded limits return `429 Too Many Requests`.
- Limits can vary by endpoint class and platform policy.
- Enforcement may combine identity, key, and network context.

## Client Strategy

- Use exponential backoff with jitter for retries.
- Avoid synchronized retries from multiple workers.
- Throttle proactively on client side for burst-heavy jobs.
- Treat repeated `429` as a signal to reduce request pressure.

## Integration Guidance

- Keep auth refresh calls strictly on demand.
- Queue non-critical telemetry (`/metrics`) during bursts.
- Prefer idempotent retry patterns for safe operations.
