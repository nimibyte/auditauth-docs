# Rate Limiting

Purpose: define request-throttling guarantees and response behavior.

## Policy

- Limit: `120` requests
- Window: `60` seconds
- Scope: global endpoint policy
- Keying: per IP

## Enforcement Behavior

- Requests above threshold are rejected.
- Rejected requests return `429 Too Many Requests`.
- Clients should apply retry backoff and burst smoothing.
