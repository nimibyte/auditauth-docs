# AuditAuth v1 Documentation

This section represents the **v1 documentation line**.

> Current project status: AuditAuth remains **beta-first** while v1 contracts are being stabilized.

Use this section as the reference for stable-oriented guidance, but validate final production decisions against the latest `beta` notes when rollout timing matters.

## What You Will Find Here

- Stable contract intent for the v1 line
- Terminology and conceptual model used across the platform
- Release-status notes for adoption planning

## Recommended Reading Order

1. Release Status
2. Concepts

If you are evaluating near-term implementation changes, review `beta` in parallel.
