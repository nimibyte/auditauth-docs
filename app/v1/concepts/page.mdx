# Concepts

Core concepts for the v1 documentation line.

## Identity Control Plane

AuditAuth externalizes authentication from application code into a centralized identity control plane.

Applications consume identity state and enforce access boundaries; they do not issue credentials directly.

## Runtime Enforcement

SDKs enforce session and token behavior at runtime boundaries:

- Protected routes
- API request verification
- Session refresh and revocation handling

## Governance and Observability

Identity events are captured as auditable records and can be correlated with runtime activity for operational visibility.

## Version Context

Although this is the v1 documentation line, AuditAuth remains in beta maturation. Treat this section as stable intent and validate fast-moving changes in `beta` when needed.
