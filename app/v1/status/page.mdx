# Release Status

AuditAuth is currently in a **beta maturation phase**.

The `v1` docs line is available to define stable direction, but some details can still evolve before general availability.

## Stability Policy

- `beta` may change faster and can include breaking adjustments.
- `v1` targets stable semantics and production-safe guidance.
- Any major contract changes should appear in `beta` first, then be promoted to `v1`.

## Adoption Guidance

- For new builds: start with `v1` concepts, then verify current implementation details in `beta`.
- For production rollouts: track release updates and migration notes from `beta` to `v1`.

## Why This Matters

This structure keeps teams aligned on long-term contracts while preserving visibility into active platform evolution.
